Contributing to CleanCode Exercise
======

This is a Java advanced exercise focused on clean code practices.

## Project Structure

The project maintains a standard Java project structure:

- Main exercise class: `CleanCode.java`
- Test class: `CleanCodeTest.java`
- Test fixture: `TexttestFixture.java` for command-line testing
- Requirements: `exercise-requirements.md` in the main package directory

## Exercise Requirements

- The starting position includes a basic structure that students can build upon
- Include at least one failing unit test to guide students
- Provide clear requirements in `exercise-requirements.md`
- Keep the initial code simple but functional

## Code Style

- Follow Java naming conventions
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Keep methods small and focused
- Prefer composition over inheritance where appropriate
- Apply clean code principles throughout
